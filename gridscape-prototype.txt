* Gridscape Prototype Tests - Alpha

Each of these tests consists of a varying electrical configuration as
outlined in the table. The initial design with parameters for
financials etc will be defined in project "Gridscape Explore Tests"
with design "Test Gridscape Prototype Test 0" being the design we clone from.
This will be setup with Simon/Dusan for reasonable parameters.
